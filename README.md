# Low-Level SML Debugger

A low-level SML Debugger that produces all information about SML run-time state as described by [The Definition of Standard ML (Revised)](http://sml-family.org/sml97-defn.pdf).

This is accomplished by using the [Poly/ML](https://www.polyml.org/) debugger on a modified version of the [HaMLet SML reference interpreter](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/hamlet/) with improved pretty printing.
